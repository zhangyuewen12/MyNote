# docker-compose

## Overview of Docker Compose

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. To learn more about all the features of Compose, see [the list of features](https://docs.docker.com/compose/#features).

Compose works in all environments: production, staging, development, testing, as well as CI workflows. You can learn more about each case in [Common Use Cases](https://docs.docker.com/compose/#common-use-cases).

Using Compose is basically a three-step process:

1. Define your app’s environment with a `Dockerfile` so it can be reproduced anywhere.
2. Define the services that make up your app in `docker-compose.yml` so they can be run together in an isolated environment.
3. Run `docker compose up` and the [Docker compose command](https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command/) starts and runs your entire app. You can alternatively run `docker-compose up` using the docker-compose binary.

A `docker-compose.yml` looks like this:

```
version: "3.9"  # optional since v1.27.0
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - .:/code
      - logvolume01:/var/log
    links:
      - redis
  redis:
    image: redis
volumes:
  logvolume01: {}
```

备注：

1. compose 是docker的一个开源项目，需要单独安装。

## Docker安装

### Install Compose on Linux systems

On Linux, you can download the Docker Compose binary from the [Compose repository release page on GitHub](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases). Follow the instructions from the link, which involve running the `curl` command in your terminal to download the binaries. These step-by-step instructions are also included below.

1. Run this command to download the current stable release of Docker Compose:

   ```
   sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   
   # 加速
   sudo curl -L "https://get.daocloud.io/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.5/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   ```

   > To install a different version of Compose, substitute `1.29.2` with the version of Compose you want to use.

   If you have problems installing with `curl`, see [Alternative Install Options](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#alternative-install-options) tab above.

2. Apply executable permissions to the binary:

   ```
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   ```

3. Test the installation.

```
$ docker-compose --version
```
