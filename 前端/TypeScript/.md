> An intersection type combines multiple types into one. This allows you to add together existing types to get a single type that has all the features you need. For example, `Person & Serializable & Loggable` is a `Person` and `Serializable` and `Loggable`. That means an object of this type will have all members of all three types.

表示这个变量同时拥有所有类型所需要的成员，可以作为其中任何一个类型使用。
