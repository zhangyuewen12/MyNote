##  TUMBLE



```sql
TUMBLE(TABLE data, DESCRIPTOR(timecol), size [, offset ])
```

- `data`: is a table parameter that can be any relation with a time attribute column.
- `timecol`: is a column descriptor indicating which [time attributes](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.14/docs/dev/table/concepts/time_attributes/) column of data should be mapped to tumbling windows.
- `size`: is a duration specifying the width of the tumbling windows.
- `offset`: is an optional parameter to specify the offset which window start would be shifted by.



# HOP

```sql
HOP(TABLE data, DESCRIPTOR(timecol), slide, size [, offset ])
```

- `data`: is a table parameter that can be any relation with an time attribute column.
- `timecol`: is a column descriptor indicating which [time attributes](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.14/docs/dev/table/concepts/time_attributes/) column of data should be mapped to hopping windows.
- `slide`: is a duration specifying the duration between the start of sequential hopping windows
- `size`: is a duration specifying the width of the hopping windows.
- `offset`: is an optional parameter to specify the offset which window start would be shifted by.



## CUMULATE

```sql
CUMULATE(TABLE data, DESCRIPTOR(timecol), step, size)
```

- `data`: is a table parameter that can be any relation with an time attribute column.
- `timecol`: is a column descriptor indicating which [time attributes](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.14/docs/dev/table/concepts/time_attributes/) column of data should be mapped to tumbling windows.
- `step`: is a duration specifying the increased window size between the end of sequential cumulating windows.
- `size`: is a duration specifying the max width of the cumulating windows. `size` must be an integral multiple of `step`.
- `offset`: is an optional parameter to specify the offset which window start would be shifted by.

For example, you could have a cumulating window for 1 hour step and 1 day max size, and you will get windows: `[00:00, 01:00)`, `[00:00, 02:00)`, `[00:00, 03:00)`, â€¦, `[00:00, 24:00)` for every day.
