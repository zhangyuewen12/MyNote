# 作业生命周期



A Flink job is first in the *created* state, then switches to *running* and upon completion of all work it switches to *finished*. In case of failures, a job switches first to *failing* where it cancels all running tasks. If all job vertices have reached a final state and the job is not restartable, then the job transitions to *failed*. If the job can be restarted, then it will enter the *restarting* state. Once the job has been completely restarted, it will reach the *created* state.

In case that the user cancels the job, it will go into the *cancelling* state. This also entails the cancellation of all currently running tasks. Once all running tasks have reached a final state, the job transitions to the state *cancelled*.

Unlike the states *finished*, *canceled* and *failed* which denote a globally terminal state and, thus, trigger the clean up of the job, the *suspended* state is only locally terminal. Locally terminal means that the execution of the job has been terminated on the respective JobManager but another JobManager of the Flink cluster can retrieve the job from the persistent HA store and restart it. Consequently, a job which reaches the *suspended* state won’t be completely cleaned up.
